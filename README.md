This is an assignment for CSC 145 that I wrote code for. This program shows changes you can make on arrays using the ArrayList library import. The arrays are as follows: The first ArrayList 'arr1' is for showing random numbers in an ArrayList and printing of the valuies in it, the second ArrayList 'arr2' is a numbered 1-12 arrayList (Printed Near The End), the third ArrayList 'arr3' is a Copy of the Original ArrayList for use of scrambleing in the fourth Arraylist 'arr4'. These are all achieved using loops! More specific directions can be found in the project directions.

Here is a quick test run of the program:
